	abstract = {In this paper, we present a dynamic model of general financial equilibrium. The model assumes utility-maximizing sectors in the economy that take the prices of the financial instruments as given. The economy, in turn, determines prices of the instruments that balance the supplies and demands. The financial adjustment process is shown to satisfy a projected dynamical system. This methodology is then used to establish, under certain conditions on the utility functions, both the stability and the asymptotical stability of the equilibrium asset, liability, and price pattern. This approach unveils a dynamic approach to competitive equilibrium problems that have, heretofore, been studied, principally, in the static framework of finite-dimensional variational inequality theory.},

The model has well specified budget constraints with respect to the economic agents (households, firms and government) within it. We introduce some standard nonlinearities into the goods and labour markets. The dynamics of the general model consist of five differential equations; we analyse two- and three-dimensional subcases to show the existence of real and monetary cycles whose interaction will determine the full dynamics. We use numerical simulation to study the dynamics of the full model and the impact of various government fiscal and monetary policies.},

And, by themselves, small frictions in nominal adjustment, such as costs of changing prices, create only small non-neutralities. But this paper shows that substantial nominal rigidity can arise from a combination of real rigidities and small nominal frictions. The paper shows the connection between real and nominal rigidity given the presence of nominal frictions both in general and for two specific sources of real rigidity, one arising from goods market imperfections and the other from labour market imperfections.},

We then demonstrate that the algorithm can be implemented on a massively parallel architecture and illustrate its performance on the Thinking Machine's CM-2 architecture. This research represents the first implementation of a massively parallel approach for the computation of either dynamical systems or variational inequality problems arising in economics.},

	abstract = {The relationship between water resources supply and demand is very complex and exhibits nonlinear characteristics, which leads to fewer models that can adequately manage the dynamic evolution process of the water resources supply-demand system. In this paper, we propose a new four-dimensional dynamical model to simulate the internal dynamic evolution process and predict future trends of water supply and demand. At the beginning, a new four-dimensional dynamical model with uncertain parameters is established. Then, the gray code hybrid accelerating genetic algorithm (GHAGA) is adopted to identify the unknown parameters of the system based on the statistic data (1998–2009). Finally, the dynamical analysis of the system is further studied by Lyapunov-exponent, phase portraits, and Lyapunov exponent theory. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed water resources supply-demand system is in a steady state and is suitable for simulating the dynamical characteristics of a complex water supply and demand system. According to the trends of the water supply and demand of several nonlinear simulation cases, the corresponding measures can be proposed to improve the steady development of the water resources supply-demand system.},

By perturbing periodically the state variable with constant impulses, the chaos can be suppressed. It is proved analytically that the obtained orbits are bounded and periodic. Moreover, it is shown for the first time that the difference equations with impulses, used to control the chaos, can generate hidden chaotic attractors. To the best of the authorsknowledge, this interesting feature has not yet been discussed. The impulsive algorithm can be used to stabilize chaos in other classes of discrete dynamical systems.},
